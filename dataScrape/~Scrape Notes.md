Did not scrape: Damage, Conversation, Feedback, Material, Material Usage, Reports.

Damage, Feedback, Material, Material Usage - zero to a few items, no need to scrape.

Conversation, Reports - There is no way to scrape the contents of each item efficiently. Might have to do page automation to be able to scrape. Probably not very important right now
